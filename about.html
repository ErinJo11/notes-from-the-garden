 <main>
    <p>Notes From the Garden grew from a simple love of flowers, plants, and the little stories they seem to hold. This project is a small digital greenhouse that is part journal and part gallery where each page card is shaped by the personalities, and histories of the plants that inspired it.</p>

    <p>The featured plants, nightshade, violet, foxglove, Solomon’s seal, ivy, and bleeding heart, were chosen not just for their beauty but for their symbolism. Some are delicate, some are poisonous, some are stubborn climbers, and some are quietly healing. Together, they create a spectrum of moods and meanings.</p>

    <p>The color palette grew from the same idea. Instead of bright, cheerful tones, Notes From the Garden leans into moody, muted colors. Soft greens, shadowy purples, and weathered neutrals work together to create something calm, lived-in, and a little mysterious.</p>

    <p>All the artwork on the site, each plant, flower, and notebook page, was drawn by me, using Illustrator or Procreate. I love drawing on my iPad, so creating the visuals for this project was one of my favorite parts.</p>

    <p>At its core, this project is a place to slow down. Think of it as a space to wander.</p>
