 <main>
    <p>Notes From the Garden grew from a simple love of flowers and plants, and the stories they seem to hold. This project is a small digital greenhouse that is part journal, part gallery and each page is inspired by the textures, personalities, and histories of the plants that shaped it.</p>

    <p>The featured plants- nightshade, violet, foxglove, Solomon’s seal, ivy, and bleeding love were chosen not just for their beauty, but for their symbolism. Some are delicate, some are poisonous, some are stubborn climbers, and some are quietly healing. Together, they reflect the spectrum of moods and meanings.</p>

    <p>The color palette follows the same idea. Instead of bright, cheerful tones, Notes From the Garden leans into the moody, muted colors you find on overcast mornings or at the edge of dusk. It includes soft greens, shadowy purples, and weathered neutrals. It’s a palette meant to feel lived-in, calm, and a little mysterious.</p>

    <p>At its core, this project is a space for slowing down, noticing small things, and appreciating the quiet character of the natural world. Think of it as a place to wander.</p>
